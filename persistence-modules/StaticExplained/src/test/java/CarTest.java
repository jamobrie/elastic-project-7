    //When to use:
//    When the value of variable is independent of objects
//    When the value is supposed to be shared across all objects

// Points to note
//    Since static variables belong to a class, they can be accessed directly using class name and don't need any object reference
//    static variables can only be declared at the class level
//    static fields can be accessed without object initialization
//    Although we can access static fields using an object reference (like ford.numberOfCars++) , we should refrain from using it as in this case it becomes difficult to figure whether itâ€™s an instance variable or a class variable; instead, we should always refer to static variables using class name (for example, in this case, Car.numberOfCars++)

    //    static methods are also widely used to create utility or helper classes so that they can be obtained without creating a new object of these classes.
//To access/manipulate static variables and other static methods that don't depend upon objects
//static methods are widely used in utility and helper classes

//    If initialization of static variables requires some additional logic except the assignment
//If the initialization of static variables is error-prone and requires exception handling
